## Lab
## Learning Outcomes
- Practice drawing stuff and working out co-ordinates
- Practice using variables and if statements in Java

Share screenshots on discord PLEASE. BugZap was a game for the BBC Micro around 40 years ago, today YOU will recreate it. Just get as much as you can working in a couple of hours and commit as you are going along. Work together and help each other! Work in a group if you want to combine your work and get practice with git.

This is a video of a game the game made in Java using the Processing libraries. 

[![YouTube](http://img.youtube.com/vi/s6PA8jtWneQ/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6PA8jtWneQ)

How you should do it:

- Accept [the assignment](https://classroom.github.com/a/DGPd3gkL) on github classroom.
- Clone the repo onto each team members computer
- Each team member make commits as you are working along

Ok let's get the main game working first and not worry about the splash screen and the game over screen

- There is a class called BugZap.java. Thats where you will be working today 
- Make sure everything works by compiling and running your program before continuing!

Now we can draw the bug.

- Make fields of type ```float``` in the BugZap class for ```playerX```, ```playerY``` and ```playerWidth``` and give these default values. You can decide what these should be. There are built in variables called ```width``` and ```height``` that give the width and height of the drawing window. These only get assigned after size has been called, so if you want to use these to give values to playerX, playerY etc. put the code into the *setup* method. 
- Write a method called void ```void drawPlayer(float x, float y, float w)``` that draws the player character, centered around the parameters x, y. You can use the line method to do this. You can pass variables as parameters to this method and also things like ```x + 20```, ```w * 0.5f``` etc. I made an extra variable in this method called h for the height and set it to be half the w parameter. Don't forget to set the stroke color!
- Call this method from ```draw```, passing in the parameters playerX, playerY and playerWidth.
- Compile and run everything to make sure it's working before continuing.
- If everything is working ok, you should see the bug on the screen

Now lets get the player moving in response to the keys

```Java
public void keyPressed()
	{
		if (keyCode == LEFT)
		{
			System.out.println("Left arrow pressed");
		}
		if (keyCode == RIGHT)
		{
			System.out.println("Right arrow pressed");
		}
		if (key == ' ')
		{
			System.out.println("SPACE key pressed");
		}
	}	
```

- If you compile and run the program again you will see that some messages get printed out when you press various keys. If you are running in Visual Studio Code, you will see these messages appear in the Debug Console
- Modify this method to increment and decrement the playerX variable instead and you should be able to get the player to move left and right
- You might want to add if statements to this method to stop the player moving off the left and right side of the screens. If statements in Java are almost the same as in C!
- When the player presses SPACE you will want to draw a line for the player's laser.

The Bug

- In a similar way to how you made the player, make the Bug. Make variables and drawBug method. Don't forget to call the method from draw()
- To move the bug you can add a random amount to it's x coordinate on intervals. To generate a random number you can use the [random](https://processing.org/reference/random_.html) function.  
- One way to make stuff happen on an interval rather than every frame is to use the frameCount variable. This variable is a field in PApplet and it gets incremented automatically every time draw is called. Because draw gets called 60 times a second, you can do something every second with this code:

```Java
if ((frameCount % 60) == 0)
{
    // Do something
}
```

- You can print text to the screen using the [text](https://processing.org/reference/text_.html) function.

Ok you should now have the basics working. See if you can figure out how to check to see if the player hits the bug, add scoring, splash screen, game over screen and sound.

## Tutorial
- [Coding Bat](https://codingbat.com/)

## Lab
## Learning outcomes
- Set up Java, Visual studio code and the Java Extensions
- Fork the repo, configure the upstream remotes
- Write your first Java Program
- Test out Github classroom

## Part 1 - Setup Java, forking and cloning

Install the software you will need for this module and set up your path to the Java Development Kit. [This document explains what you need](install.md).

Fork this repository by clicking the fork button above, so that you get your own copy of the course repo to work on this semester. Now create a new empty folder on your computer somewhere right click on the folder and choose git bash here. Alternatively you can start the bash and cd to the new folder. To clone the repository for your fork:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOURGITUSERNAME/OOP-2024
```

Replace YOURGITUSERNAME with your github username. You can also copy the URL to the repo from your browser and paste it into the console. To paste into the bash on Windows is right click. You can use Cmd + C, Cmd + V on the Mac.

Now cd into the repo and check the origin and upstream remotes are set up correctly

```bash
cd OOP-2024
git remote -v
```

You should see something like this:

```bash
origin  https://github.com/YOURGITUSERNAME/OOP-2024 (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/YOURGITUSERNAME/OOP-2024 (push)
upstream  https://github.com/skooter500/OOP-2024 (fetch)
upstream  https://github.com/skooter500/OOP-2024 (push)
```

If you don't see the upstream remote, you can set it up by typing

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/skooter500/OOP-2024
```
You can read more about forking a git repository and setting up the upstream remote in [this article](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo)

Once the upstream is setup, you will be able to push code to your own repo and also keep it up to date with the master branch of the changes I make each class.

If you already forked the repo before the lab, you may need to update your master branch from my master branch to get the changes I made:

```bash
git fetch
git checkout master
git pull upstream master
git push
```

Open the OOP-2024 folder in Visual Studio Code. You can run your program by choosing Run | Start Debugger. *Important for users of the Lab computers* In the labs you should use the shell scripts ```compile.sh``` and ```run.sh``` located in the Java folder to compile and run your code. You can run these from the Bash. 

You should see

```
Hello world
Woof. I am Misty
Woof. I am Lucy
cats are from space
```
Congratulations! You have successfully compiled and run your first Java program. 

## Part 2

Accept [this assignment on Github classroom](https://classroom.github.com/a/5nyQb4Oa)

You can open it in Codespaces or clone the repo and open on your computer. 

Submit your solution by doing a commit

- Create a Cat class
- Make a private ```int``` field on the Cat class called numLives.
- Write public accessors for the field (see how I did this for the name field on the Animal class)
- Set the value of this field to 9 in the Cat constructor  
- Write a method (functions are called methods in Java) on the Cat class called kill. It should subtract 1 from numLives if numLives is > 0 and print the message "Ouch!". If numLives is 0, you should just print the message "Dead"
- Create a new instance of the Cat class like this

    ```Java
    Cat ginger = new Cat("Ginger");
    ```
- In the Main class in a loop, call kill on ginger until ginger is dead.
- Compile and run your program until you have no bugs and you get the desired output.

Commit and push your changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "killing the cat"
git push
```
